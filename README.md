MacDroid Sync
========================

This is a project that I'm starting to make it easier for me to sync iTunes on my Mac
with my Android phone.  Sure, other projects exist for this, but they're either expensive
or they don't work very well (or both).  I want to make a free, open source version that
is simple to use, syncs your playlists and tracks both ways and I can use it myself!

I may, at some point, create a GUI version and put it on the Android store for cheap, but
the script that resides here will always be free and open source.
