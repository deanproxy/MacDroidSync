MacDroid Sync
========================

This is a project that I'm starting to make it easier for me to sync iTunes on my Mac
with my Android phone.  I want to make a free, open source version that
is simple to use, syncs your playlists and tracks both ways and I can use it myself!

I was planning on making this for release, but in the midst of research I found a great
alternative that actually supports Windows too and is way more polished than mine will
probably be.  It's called [iSyncr](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jrtstudio.iSyncr4Mac&hl=en).
It's not very expensive and works like a charm!
